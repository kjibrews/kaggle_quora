# Kaggle Quora Insincere Questions
This repo contains my approach to [Kaggle Insincere Questions Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-insincere-questions-classification).

Normal markdown <u>underlined text</u>, **bold text** etc.

Description: Quora is an online question and answer platform with content created from its community of users. To enable a safe community, Quora needs to eliminate "insincere" questions. These types of questions include questions that are: disparaging or inflammatory, asked purely for shock value, have a non-neutral tone and are not grounded in reality. 

* Examples of Sincere questions:
  * How did Quebec nationalists see their province as a nation in the 1960s?
  * Do you have an adopted dog, how would you encourage people to adopt and not shop?
* Examples of Insincere questions:
  * Which babies are more sweeter to their parents? Dark skin babies or light skin babies?
  * If blacks support school choice and mandatory sentencing for criminals why don't they vote Republican?

Limitations:
* Kernels only competition
  * No custom packages
  * RAM Limitations 
  * RAM limitations Â (CPU : 17 GB, GPU: 14 GB), 
  * if using GPU no custom packages were allowed 
  * Runtime limitations (CPU: 6 hours, GPU: 2 hours)

* Data needed to be cleaned before being processed by the model.
* Class Imbalance in training set (Sincere: ~95% , Insincere ~5%). 
* English only word embeddings
  * Quite a few non- English expressions meant extensive data cleaning is needed
